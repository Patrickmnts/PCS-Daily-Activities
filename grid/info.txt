1. Create an html page with a 3x3 grid with divs that are 80x80 pixels with 10 pix of padding all around. give them all background color of light gray.
underneath the grid add a link with the worde "Wipe" in it.

2.  when you click on a box, change the background color of the box to blue. clicking again reverts the color to gray.
When you click the whipe link, all the boxes should revert back to gray.

If all boxes are green show a hidden div that says congratulations!
